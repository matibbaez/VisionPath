## 1. Services
VisionPath agrees to provide software development, UI/UX design, and web solutions according to the technical and functional specifications agreed upon in the Commercial Proposal approved by the Client.

## 2. Intellectual Property
* **Client Rights:** Upon 100% payment of the project, the Client shall be the exclusive owner of all final source code, designs, and interfaces created specifically for their product.
* **VisionPath Rights:** We retain usage rights over our "know-how," generic code libraries, methodologies, and pre-existing tools used to accelerate development.
* **Portfolio:** Unless a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) is signed, VisionPath reserves the right to display the work in its portfolio and communication channels.

## 3. Payments & Billing
* **Start:** A 50% deposit (or the percentage stipulated in the Proposal) is required to commence work.
* **Delivery:** The remaining balance is due upon final delivery or deployment to production.
* **Suspension:** VisionPath reserves the right to halt development or suspend service if invoices remain unpaid for more than 7 business days.

## 4. Technical Warranty
We offer a **30-day** post-launch warranty period. During this time, we will fix any code errors ("bugs") attributable to our development at no additional cost.
**Exclusions:** This warranty does not cover issues caused by third-party modifications, external service updates (APIs), or changes to the original requirements.

## 5. Liability
Our maximum liability for any claim related to the service is limited to the total amount paid by the Client for the specific project. We are not liable for lost profits or indirect damages.

## 6. Confidentiality
Both parties agree to protect confidential information (strategies, user data, trade secrets) shared during the business relationship and not to disclose it to third parties without prior consent.
